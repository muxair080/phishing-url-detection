This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. I have downloaded dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taruntiwarihp/phishing-site-urls/data  which are web links designed to deceive users into giving away sensitive information. Various features are extracted from these URLs, such as the structure of the link and the presence of suspicious keywords.

The core of the project lies in training an artificial neural network (ANN) model using deep learning. This model learns from the dataset, enabling it to recognize patterns associated with phishing URLs. Once trained, the model can quickly analyze new URLs and determine if they are likely to be phishing attempts.
